# GA-Projects

Projects listed here are related to my 12-week study in General Assembly Sydney, Data Science Immersive Course. The course starts by covering the basics of Python programming and statistics before moving on to Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), SQL, and web-scraping. The majority of the curriculum then covers the wide variety of machine learning models and the optimisation techniques employed for each one.

The course is incredibly detailed, with the main areas of study being:
- Python: NumPy, Pandas, data cleaning and visualization
- Github: Utilising the software in a professional setting, operating from Command Prompt and branching/pulling from Master
- Machine Learning: Regression, Classification and Clustering algorithms in detail, with a thorough understanding of the mathematical and statistical justifications for their use
- Web Scraping: Using Spiders, XPath, BeautifulSoup4 and Selenium to scrape data from websites and processing using Python

Some of notable projects are:
1. Job Market Analysis:
Scraped Data related jobs from job portal website to analyze which features contributed to predicting the salary.

Tag: Web Scraping / Word Cloud / Word2Vec / Tfidf / CountVectorizer / Tree-based Classifier / Logistic Regression

2. House Price Prediction:
Predicted sales prices and practice feature engineering using kaggle's Ames Housing dataset. Used statistical analysis to optimize investment and maximize return.

Tag: Feature Engineering / Regularisation Techniques / Generalized Linear Model / Residual analysis 

3. Fake News Detector:
Using NLP(Natural Language Processing) techniques and several classification models to implement a machine learning pipeine to predict whether a news is fake or not.

Tag: Web Scraping / NLP / Pipeline / GridSearchCV
