Apply now or head along to\xa0www.wowcareers.com.au\xa0to discover more!","People Data Analyst - 6 month fixed term contract Our Story: The Woolworths Group has been focused on levering digital and data to create better team and customer experiences. We want to create shopping experiences that are personalised, seamless and convenient, and for that we need an empowered, engaged and capable team. To help achieve that goal, we have a People Insights team that use our wealth of people data to better understand what our teams need to thrive. What we do: We are part of the People Delivery Office at Woolworths - a team that gets work done while having fun and maintaining balance. As part of the People Reporting and Insights team, you will collaborate closely with a team of experienced people data analysts/scientists. Together, we will make sense of excitingly complex and multifaceted data. We want to be known for delivering reports and insights that are timely, solid and impactful. Given the complexity and volume of data that we work with (as a reminder, Woolworths employs about 200.000 people), we increasingly need to rely on state-of-the-art and custom-built automated reports, dashboards and insights-generating algorithms. That is where you come in. Where we are: Our team is based at the Eight Mile Plains Technology Park, a short drive south of Brisbane. This new site has been designed to support flexible working with spaces that facilitate collaboration, video conferencing, brainstorming or just having a yarn. There is ample parking and the site can be reached by bike or public transport as well. What we are looking for: The purpose of this role is to develop and productionize reports, dashboards and algorithms to make sense of our people and performance data. Working together with a team of experienced HR analysts and a data scientist, you will work out technical solutions that make more data available to the business while reducing manual work. You will also help the team out with ad hoc requests for data raised by Culture and People Partners and you will work on developing more advanced insights and solutions to automatically mine our wealth of data for relevant information. The roles key objectives include: Develop, test and productionize automated reports and dashboards in GCP that were previously run out of SuccessFactors, Spinifex, Salesforce or other people data source systems. Organise automated access to reports and dashboards through detailed role-based permissions in GCP. Assist others in the team in transitioning to state-of-the-art data mining and insights generation. Make people data available to Culture and People partners and other clients throughout the business. This involves keeping track of cases as they are raised through Salesforce, engaging with clients to understand their needs in detail, and delivering the data safely and efficiently. Design and develop new dashboards in collaboration with business clients and other analysts to replace commonly requested reports. This will include setting up automated processes for refreshing the data behind the dashboards and for keeping role-based permissions up to date. Assist our Data Scientist by supporting the more complex work underway and/or drive your own data science initiative(s). Who you are: You are a team player who is driven to achieve the best result and is excited about digging through data and turning it into insights for a larger audience. You’re curious and empathetic, and the prospect of improving the working lives of thousands of Australians through data energises you. You deal with complexity by collaborating with colleagues, listening to business partners, testing ideas and continuously learning. You take authorship for and pride in what you create, and are open to feedback when a work product needs to evolve. Our business moves fast and moves often, so we all have to be nimble and able to work in an ambiguous and constantly changing environment. What's in it for you: The opportunity to contribute to the transformation of our People Data team - which is part of one of the largest HR shared services centres in Australia. Experience that is increasingly wanted in the marketplace: leveraging People Data is rising to the top of the priority list of many business leaders; your contributions to our transformation will serve your career well. Training and Education: we pride ourselves in helping you realise your potential and give you the opportunity to be innovative. You will have the opportunity to improve your skills in working with the Google Cloud Platform (BigQuery, DataStudio, DataPrep, etc.) and Tableau; both are among the fastest growing analytics, big data and visualisation platforms available in the market. You will be given access to and time for attending relevant online courses, and go on a learning journey together with the rest of the team. A great working environment: the Eight Mile Plains support office is a great place to work, located in a beautiful part of the country.
